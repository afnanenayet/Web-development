        </h2>
        <p>Japan's Citizen has been on the market for decades. While their vintage mechanical movements are well-respected for their price range, relatively recently they converted their entire collection to utilize their proprietary Eco-Drive technology, thus making all of their watches solar-powered quartz. Eco-Drive watches are known for their longevity, able to last for months or more on a single charge, and able to go decades before a battery change is required. Like <a href="seiko.html">Seiko</a>, they are known for excellent quality and service, and offer affordable watches of many different styles. They also manufacture well-known ebauche movements that are used by many other brands, under the Miyota name.</p>
