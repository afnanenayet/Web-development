        </h2>
        <p>Perhaps the most notable Japanese watch company, Seiko was the first company to mass-market quartz watches, and became a household name practically overnight because of it. Although not Swiss, Seiko is considered every bit as good a brand as any of the Swiss companies. They manufacture all of their own movements, both mechanical and quartz, and the latter are still some of the best quartz movements on the market. They manufacture ebauche movements as well, which are used by many other manufacturers around the world. Seiko is still innovating, and they have invented new movements such as the Kinetic and the Spring Drive in the past twenty years.</p>
